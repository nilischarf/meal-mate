README test 
README.md is a Markdown file that should describe your project. You will replace the contents of this README.md file with a description of your actual project.

Markdown is not a language that we cover in Flatiron's Software Engineering curriculum, but it's not a particularly difficult language to learn (if you've ever left a comment on Reddit, you might already know the basics). Refer to the cheat sheet in this assignments's resources for a basic guide to Markdown.

What Goes into a README?
This README serves as a template. Replace the contents of this file to describe the important files in your project and describe what they do. Each Python file that you edit should get at least a paragraph, and each function should be described with a sentence or two.

Describe your actual CLI script first, and with a good level of detail. The rest should be ordered by importance to the user. (Probably functions next, then models.)

Screenshots and links to resources that you used throughout are also useful to users and collaborators, but a little more syntactically complicated. Only add these in if you're feeling comfortable with Markdown.
